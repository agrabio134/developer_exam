Table Waitlist
A minimal restaurant waitlist management prototype built using Next.js 14 (App Router) and JavaScript.

Tech Stack & Features

Next.js 14 (App Router): Utilized for modern routing and server components.
JavaScript: Used as per assignment requirements.
Plain CSS: Lightweight, custom styling optimized for mobile devices.
React-Toastify: Added for simple, non-intrusive alert notifications.
Mongoose + MongoDB: Integrated for database operations.
Core Features:

Waitlist form submission
Table management
Server-side actions
Seated guest logging

*Note: Initially, I used Express.js out of familiarity. However, I challenged myself to adopt a more Next.js-native approach to better align with modern full-stack practices.
