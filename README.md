Table Waitlist 
A minimal restaurant waitlist management prototype built with Next.js 14 (App Router) and JavaScript.
Tech Choices

Next.js 14 (App Router): For modern routing and Server Components.
Plain CSS: Lightweight, custom styling for a mobile-friendly UI.
JavaScript: Per assignment requirements


*note: Initially i still used Express JS for this one since I'm comfortable using it, but I challenge myself to use what's more suitable in Next, which is next itself


Add Mongoose for MongoDB integration.
Implement waitlist form, table, and server actions.
Add seated log
